# Research Proposal: Personal Investing Dashboard

By Justin Reed, Maria Maragkelli, Reghan Hesser

## Research Question

This section should cover:

1. What do we want to know or what problems are we trying to solve? As in the midterm, you should list (1) the “bigger” question/debate/problem you’re interested in, and also (2) the specific research question(s) you’ll actually try to answer.

    - The research question will be smaller in scope than the big picture question. But the answer to your specific research question should shed light on the bigger question (although it likely won’t conclusively answer it).

    - The answer to your specific research question should shed light on the bigger question (although it likely won’t conclusively answer it).

2. If your project is about relationships, what are the hypotheses you’re testing?

3. If your project is about prediction, what is your metrics of success? (What are you maximizing?) Can you find a baseline from prior work to give you a ball park to aim for?

## Necessary Data

This section should cover:

1. What does the final dataset need to look like (mostly dictated by the question and the availability of data):
    - What is an observation, e.g. a firm, or a firm-year, etc.
    - What is the sample period?
    - What are the sample conditions? (Years, restrictions you anticipate (e.g. exclude or require some industries)
    - What variables are absolutely necessary and what would you like to have if possible?
2. What data do we have and what data do we need?
3. How will we colelct more data?
4. What ar ethe raw inputs and how will you store them  (the folder structure(s) for each input type)?
5. Speculate at a high level (not specific code!) about how you’ll transform the raw data into the final form.



## Dictionary for Terms from Article

1. DC: Defined contribution
    - Every year, Americans contribute about 5% of their total employee compensation to defined contribution (DC) pension plans
2. QDIA: Qualified Default Investment Alternative
    - Default options in DC plans
    - Most popular type of QDIA is a portfolio that provides "long-term appreciation and capital preservation through a mix of equity and fixed income exposures based on the participant's age"
    - Regulators rely on "generally accepted investment theories"
    - Basically advice is split investments across stocks and bonds and invest more in stocks while young than while old.
3. TDF: Target-date fund
    - This is a type of QDIA
    - A TDF basically targets a specific year as the retirement age and then rebalances the fund every so often according to that target
    - Effectively as retiree moves closer to retirement date, stocks $\downarrow$ and bonds $\uparrow$




## Important information from Article

- Evaluate strategies based on: Wealth at retirement, retirement income, conservation of savings, and bequest at death.
  - Study lifecycle portfolios on long-horizon returns rather than short-horizon (monthly/annual) returns given nature of retirement investing
- Simple, all-equity portfolio outperforms QDIAs across all retirement outcomes.
- Strategy of 50% in domestic stocks and 50% international stocks throughout one's lifetime (Not a QDIA) dominates QDIAs in capital preservation
